pynbody
=======

Pynbody is a light-weight, portable, format-transparent analysis framework for N-body and hydrodynamic 
astrophysical simulations supporting PKDGRAV/Gasoline, Gadget, N-Chilada, and RAMSES AMR outputs. 

Written in python, the core tools are accompanied by a library of publication-level analysis routines.
