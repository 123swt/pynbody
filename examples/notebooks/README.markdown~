#Pynbody IPython notebooks

The [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is a tool for
interactive data exploration. We have prepared a few notebooks to
complement our tutorials -- you can think of them as interactive
totorials. These notebooks can be viewed as static content via the
[IPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org) using the links
below, or you can use them as starting points for your own analysis.

For more information, see the [IPython notebook
documentation](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/htmlnotebook.html). 


##Pynbody notebooks available through the Notebook viewer

##Using the notebooks interactively

If you have a recent version of IPython (> 0.12) you should be able to use these notebooks interactively. Copy them to a different directory and start the notebook server from that directory:

'''
mkdir pynbody_notebooks
cd pynbody_notebooks
ipython notebook --pylab inline
'''
